I gained proficiency in using the R programming language for data analysis, visualization, and manipulation, setting the foundation for implementing various data mining algorithms.

## Exploring Data

Explored techniques for data exploration, understanding data distributions, and identifying patterns and trends through visualization and statistical analysis.

## Linear Regression

Mastered the concept of linear regression, a fundamental technique for predicting numerical outcomes based on input features.

## Components of Learning

Understood the essential components involved in the learning process, including training, testing, and validation.

## Supervised Learning: Classification

Explored classification algorithms, their applications, and the process of training models to categorize data into predefined classes.

## Decision Tree Models

Learned the principles behind decision tree models and their effectiveness in making decisions based on input features.

## Performance Evaluation of Decision Tree Models

Explored methods for evaluating the performance of decision tree models, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Alternative Techniques

Investigated alternative techniques in classification, such as oversampling, undersampling, and hypothesis testing, to address imbalanced datasets.

## Association Rules

Explored association rules and their applications in market basket analysis, understanding the relationships between items in a dataset.

## Neural Networks: The Perceptron Model

Studied the basics of neural networks, starting with the perceptron model and its variations, including multilayer perceptrons.

## Unsupervised Learning

Explored unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering methods such as K-Means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering.
